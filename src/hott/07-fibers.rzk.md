## Fibers

The homotopy fiber of a map is the following type:

```rzk title="The fiber of a map"
#def fib
  (A B : U)
  (f : A → B)
  (b : B)
  : U
  := Σ (a : A) , (f a) = b
```

We calculate the transport of (a , q) : fib b along p : a = a':

```rzk
#def transport-in-fiber
  ( A B : U)
  ( f : A → B)
  ( b : B)
  ( a a' : A)
  ( u : (f a) = b)
  ( p : a = a')
  : ( transport A ( \ x → (f x) = b) a a' p u) =
    ( concat B (f a') (f a) b (ap A B a' a f (rev A a a' p)) u)
  :=
    ind-path
      ( A)
      ( a)
      ( \ a'' p' →
        ( transport (A) (\ x → (f x) = b) (a) (a'') (p') (u)) =
        ( concat (B) (f a'') (f a) (b) (ap A B a'' a f (rev A a a'' p')) (u)))
      ( rev
        ( (f a) = b) (concat B (f a) (f a) b refl u) (u)
        ( left-unit-concat B (f a) b u))
      ( a')
      ( p)
```

## Contractible maps

A map is contractible just when its fibers are contractible.

```rzk title="Contractible maps"
#def is-contr-map
  (A B : U)
  (f : A → B)
  : U
  := (b : B) → is-contr (fib A B f b)
```

Contractible maps are equivalences:

```rzk
#section is-contr-map-is-equiv

#variables A B : U
#variable f : A → B
#variable is-contr-f : is-contr-map A B f
```

```rzk title="The inverse to a contractible map"
#def is-contr-map-inverse
  : B → A
  := \ b → first (contraction-center (fib A B f b) (is-contr-f b))

#def has-section-is-contr-map
  : has-section A B f
  :=
    ( is-contr-map-inverse ,
      \ b → second (contraction-center (fib A B f b) (is-contr-f b)))

#def is-contr-map-data-in-fiber uses (is-contr-f)
  (a : A)
  : fib A B f (f a)
  := (is-contr-map-inverse (f a) , (second has-section-is-contr-map) (f a))

#def is-contr-map-path-in-fiber
  (a : A)
  : (is-contr-map-data-in-fiber a) =_{fib A B f (f a)} (a , refl)
  := contractible-connecting-htpy
      ( fib A B f (f a))
      ( is-contr-f (f a))
      ( is-contr-map-data-in-fiber a)
      ( a , refl)

#def is-contr-map-has-retraction uses (is-contr-f)
  : has-retraction A B f
  :=
    ( is-contr-map-inverse ,
      \ a → ( ap (fib A B f (f a)) A
                ( is-contr-map-data-in-fiber a)
                ( (a , refl))
                ( \ u → first u)
                ( is-contr-map-path-in-fiber a)))

#def is-equiv-is-contr-map uses (is-contr-f)
  : is-equiv A B f
  := (is-contr-map-has-retraction , has-section-is-contr-map)

#end is-contr-map-is-equiv
```

## Half adjoint equivalences are contractible

We now show that half adjoint equivalences are contractible maps.

```rzk title="If f is a half adjoint equivalence, its fibers are inhabited"
#def is-surj-is-half-adjoint-equiv
  (A B : U)
  (f : A → B)
  (is-HAE-f : is-half-adjoint-equiv A B f)
  (b : B)
  : fib A B f b
  :=
    ( (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b ,
      (second (second (first is-HAE-f))) b)
```

It takes much more work to construct the contracting homotopy. The bath path of
this homotopy is straightforward.

```rzk
#section half-adjoint-equivalence-fiber-data

#variables A B : U
#variable f : A → B
#variable is-HAE-f : is-half-adjoint-equiv A B f
#variable b : B
#variable z : fib A B f b

#def is-HAE-fib-base-path
  : ((map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b) = (first z)
  :=
    concat A
      ( (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b)
      ( (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) (f (first z)))
      ( first z)
      ( ap B A b (f (first z)) (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f))
        ( rev B (f (first z)) b (second z)))
      ( (first (second (first is-HAE-f))) (first z))
```

Specializing the above to `#!rzk isHAE-fib-base-path`:

```rzk
#def is-HAE-fib-base-path-transport
  : transport A (\ x → (f x) = b)
      ( (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b) (first z)
      ( is-HAE-fib-base-path )
      ( (second (second (first is-HAE-f))) b) =
    concat B (f (first z)) (f ((map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b)) b
      ( ap A B (first z) ((map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b) f
          ( rev A ((map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b) (first z)
            ( is-HAE-fib-base-path )))
      ( (second (second (first is-HAE-f))) b)
  :=
    transport-in-fiber A B f b
      ( (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b) (first z)
      ( (second (second (first is-HAE-f))) b)
      ( is-HAE-fib-base-path )

Finally, we may define the contracting homotopy:

```rzk
#def is-HAE-fib-contracting-homotopy
  : (is-surj-is-half-adjoint-equiv A B f is-HAE-f b) = z
  :=
    path-of-pairs-pair-of-paths A
    ( \ x → (f x) = b)
    ( (map-inverse-has-inverse A B f (first is-HAE-f)) b)
    ( first z)
    ( is-HAE-fib-base-path)
    ( (second (second (first is-HAE-f))) b)
    ( second z)
    ( is-HAE-fib-base-path-transport-path)

#end half-adjoint-equivalence-fiber-data
```

Half adjoint equivalences define contractible maps:

```rzk
#def is-contr-map-is-half-adjoint-equiv
  (A B : U)
  (f : A → B)
  (is-HAE-f : is-half-adjoint-equiv A B f)
  : is-contr-map A B f
  := \ b →
        ( is-surj-is-half-adjoint-equiv A B f is-HAE-f b ,
          \ z → is-HAE-fib-contracting-homotopy A B f is-HAE-f b z)
```
